memtransfer
===========

A quick evening project, acting as a quick proof/mental re-assurance that gigabit speeds are possible and that disks are (most often) the bottlenecks.

It is an hour or two of Java coding that essentially loads a file into memory on the client machine, spits it across as fast as possible to the server machine, who receives it, then saves it.

The goal is to be able to see what the true practical limits on gigabit speeds are. More often than not, just transfering files is bottlenecked by files and you can't really see what it can do, this is just a simple few Java classes that just play around and see what can be done quickly.
